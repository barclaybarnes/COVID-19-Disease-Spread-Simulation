# COVID-19 Agent-Based Simulation (SEIRV)

This project implements an **agent-based SEIRV (Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered–Vaccinated)** model of COVID-19 using Python.

The simulation represents individuals as agents interacting under probabilistic rules, allowing exploration of **mask usage, vaccination rates, and stochastic variability** in disease spread. It also compares **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** results against deterministic SEIR differential equations (ODEs) for validation.

---

## Project Overview

The model extends classical SEIR equations into a probabilistic agent-based environment. Each agent has attributes such as:

- **Infection state:** S, E, I, R, V  
- **Mask usage**  
- **Vaccination status**

Agents meet randomly each day, and infections occur with probability:

P(infection) = β ⋅ (1 − e_m) ⋅ (1 − e_v)

Where:

- β = base transmission probability  
- e_m = mask effectiveness  
- e_v = vaccine effectiveness  

This setup enables simulation of different intervention strategies and their impact on outbreak dynamics.

## New Features

- Resource monitoring: background `ResourceMonitor` collects per\-process and system metrics and writes `resource_usage.csv` (requires `psutil`).
- Warm\-up of CPU counters, per\-sample error diagnostics, and stable CSV output (writes `"N/A"` when metrics are unavailable).
- Multi\-run analysis: `run_multiple.py` runs many stochastic simulations, computes mean ± std, exports `simulation_results_mean.csv`, and optionally overlays ODE results.
- Animated visualization: `animated_epidemic_curve.py` animates results from `simulation_results.csv` with interactive controls (play/pause, checkboxes, slider).
- Validation improvements: `validation.py` continues to solve ODE SEIRV via `scipy.integrate.odeint` and now reports diagnostics and overlays ABM CSV when available.
- CSV logging: all major modules export deterministic CSVs for reproducibility (`simulation_results.csv`, `simulation_results_mean.csv`, `resource_usage.csv`).
- Requirements updated: `psutil` required for resource monitoring; `python>=3.11` is listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

### Run a Single Simulation

Runs one SEIRV agent-based simulation and plots epidemic curves.

```bash
python main.py
```
Output:

simulation_results.csv saved

Infection curve plotted

### Validate Against Theoretical SEIRV (ODE)

Compares Agent-Based Model (ABM) results to a deterministic SEIRV differential equation model.
```bash
python -m validation
```
Output:

Displays a shaded uncertainty plot (mean ± std. deviation)

Compares ODE predictions with ABM outcomes

### Run Multi-run (mean ± std) and Resource Monitor
Runs n_runs simulations, computes mean and std deviation, saves simulation_results_mean.csv, and records resource usage to resource_usage.csv.
```bash
python -m run_multiple
```

| Environment   | Holds the entire population and defines contact rules  |
| Simulation    | Core SEIRV logic controlling infection and recovery    |

### Validation Strategy

The ABM results are validated via:

Comparative Validation

Empirical Validation
Comparing simulated outbreak shapes to early COVID-19 data.

Stochastic Replication
Running multiple iterations to measure variability and ensure consistency.
