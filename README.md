This project develops an agent-based simulation of COVID-19 using the SEIRV (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, Vaccinated) framework.
Each agent represents an individual with personal attributes such as mask use and vaccination status.
Agents interact randomly each day, and transmission occurs probabilistically according to calibrated parameters from published research.
The model extends the classical SEIR equations to a stochastic environment, capturing variability and uncertainty in epidemic outcomes.

Implemented in Python, the simulation logs population states over time, visualizes infection curves, and validates its behavior against an analytical SEIRV differential-equation model.
Multiple runs support statistical averaging to evaluate intervention effectiveness.

This tool provides a flexible platform for exploring the impact of preventive measures, vaccination rates, and transmission parameters on epidemic dynamics.
It is designed for educational, analytical, and research use in studying infectious-disease spread.
